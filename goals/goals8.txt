Watch files

As of now, this means:
- regenerate parser files when grammar or translator are modified
- regenerate translations when parser files are regenerated
- reload gulp if gulpfile or includes are touched, as well as package.json
- If package.json, then run npm i automatically
- transpile all js files, including bin
- retranspile if preset is changed
- Catch when files are added or deleted
- Retroaction when a dest is altered directly
