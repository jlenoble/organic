Watch files

As of now, this means:
- regenerate parser files when grammars are modified
- retranspile gulp js files when touched
- retranspile translators js files when touched




- regenerate parser files when translator are modified
- regenerate translations when parser files are regenerated
- reload gulp if gulpfile or includes are touched, as well as package-lock.json
- If package.json, then run npm i automatically
- retranspile if preset is changed
- Catch when files are added or deleted
- Retroaction when a dest is altered directly
