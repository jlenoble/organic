Improve goal6.txt translator

1) It should not regenerate parser files when the grammar is not changed.
2) It should save the translations with a meaningful name.

Module gulp-antlr4-newer was specifically written as a by-product to
accomplish the first goal.

Goal 2 works almost out of the box by just adding a gulp.dest(dest) to the
translate function.

But the translated contains an extra line (due to console.log). Therefore a
new target is added to the grammar: lastline.

Goal is reached.
